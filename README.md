# Duet Display Website Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Duet Display website created using HTML and CSS. The Duet Display website is a platform that allows users to extend their computer screens using other devices, such as iPads and Android devices. This repository contains an attempt to replicate the Duet Display website for educational purposes, particularly to improve HTML and CSS skills. Please note that this is not an exact replica of the original website, but an exercise undertaken to learn and practice web development techniques.

For a live preview of the website, you can visit it [here](https://rulkimi.github.io/duet-display-clone/).

## Purpose

This repository serves as a self-improvement and practice project for web development enthusiasts. It is not intended for commercial use or redistribution. Feel free to clone this repository, explore the code, and use it as a learning resource to enhance your web development skills.

## Project Overview

In this project, I replicated various sections of the Duet Display website to showcase its main features. Here's an overview of the key sections and elements of the code:

### Header

The header section includes the Duet logo, navigation links (Reviews, Features, Pricing, Sign in), and a "Start 1 Week Trial" button for user registration.

### Reviews Section

The reviews section showcases snippets from various reviews, each accompanied by an icon representing the source of the review. These snippets highlight positive feedback about Duet Display.

### Get Started Section

The "Get Started" section serves as a call to action, encouraging users to take action. It includes a brief message and a "Get Started" button.
